* Scaffold

  this is a multi language project starter kit which powered by cookiecutter.
  https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/2.3.0/advanced/directories.html

  #+begin_src bash
    pipx install cookiecutter
    pipx inject cookiecutter jinja2_base64_filters # (optional) (js-web uses this plugin)
  #+end_src

  naming convention of subdirectory is {program language}-{application type}(optional)

  ex. application type

  - cli
  - web
  - sdk
  - lib

  etc..

** Example usages

  cookiecutter https://github.com/user/repo-name.git --directory="directory1-name"
  it's assumed the project scaffold contains multiple project so the director1-name is one of the project directory

  Take my repo as an example. You can create a project like below

  #+begin_src bash
    cookiecutter scaffold # by default, it will output to the current working directory
    cookiecutter scaffold -o [output directory]
  #+end_src

  if you don't specify --directory, by default, you will get a prompt to select the option.
